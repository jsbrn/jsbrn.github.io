                I love programming and I've been doing it a long time. I earned a computer science degree in university and built many hobby projects over the years. 
                Each one taught me something new (or many things).
                Having this skillset has defined my life for the last 15 or so years, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
            </p>

                For most of my career I've been a Scala developer. I enjoy the type safety and first-class functions. 
                Object-oriented programming has a lot of problems, especially with large complex domains. 
                Being able to balance type safety with flexibility is important for building large-scale systems.
